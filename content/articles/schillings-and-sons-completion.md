This piano is ready to go home again.  It is performing well and looking good.  Final tasks were case renewal with my favorite tool for old finishes:  [Howard's Restor-a-finish](https://www.howardproducts.com/product/restor-a-finish/).   Also, I made a good repair to lower case damage that was incurred in a move at some point.

A satisfaction test.
