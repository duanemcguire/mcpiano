This Kawai studio piano was built in Japan in 1973. I recently completed reconditioning of this fine piano in my shop.

I have performed the following services on this piano:

- Re-shaped and voiced hammers to develop a lustrous tonal response
- Levelled keyboard
- Fully regulated the action, for full artistic expression
- Made minor repairs to the case
- Cleaned and polished case
- Reconditioned pedals and trapwork
- Tuned to concert pitch

Upon completion of reconditioning, I've played this piano for many hours, and I have found it to be a delight. The action is silky smooth, giving the pianist delicate control and full dynamic response.

This piano is an excellent purchase for  beginning and intermediate piano students.   Kawai produced this model with the school  market in mind.  You will find later editions of this model everywhere in universities, schools, and churches.  It's simple lines make it a nice fit anywhere. The sale includes:
 - Bench.
 - One free in-home tuning.
 - Free “normal delivery” in Davis or Weber Counties. (No difficult turns, 4 or fewer steps to go up or down) - One year warranty.

Price: $1,950.00

You'll find new prices for a similar piano from Kawai today at about $6000.
