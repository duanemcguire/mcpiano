The right tool for the job isn't always obvious.

**Requirements:** \- pin should come out straight - no damage should be made to the original hole - the process should be efficient

**Today's solution:** A slightly modified pop rivet gun removes balance rail key pins axially, thus avoiding damage of the original hole. The only modification to the tool was to bore out the tip of the tool to match the diameter of the key pin.
