My piano business exists to create joy in playing the piano. Below are some customer comments. I aim to achieve this level of satisfaction with all my customers.

Duane, I would recommend you to anyone for any piano related tuning or work. I really appreciate your love and enthusiasm for the instrument. And your willingness to explain everything to me.  

Thanks again. You do great work.

When our former piano tuner retired we were nervous about finding someone that we could fully trust with tuning and repairs. After a trying a couple different tuners we were happy to find Duane McGuire! We have been working with him since Fall 2013 and have been very impressed with his knowledge and skills. He is also very reliable and respects our time. He is our tuner of choice!

Hi Duane,  
I wanted to say thank you again for coming out to see our piano last week and making is sound great! I also wanted to say thank you for recommending the Howard’s Restore products. I am amazed at how easy it was to use and how incredible the piano looks now!  

Thanks again!

Duane:  
Thank you for restoring the piano’s capabilities today. It was a delight to see someone who has pride in what they do – sadly a less common virtue than it used to be. The piano hasn’t sounded this good ever – even when it was delivered and tuned when new. You can count on my never ending loyality to you!
