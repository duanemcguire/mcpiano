Learn about pianos first. I think that most piano buyers are more knowledgeable about their cars, than about pianos! But there's is a cure for that problem.

The best guide is online here: [The Piano Buyer](https://pianobuery.com/piano-buying-basics).

Once you have studied this resource, you'll be in a good position as an informed buyer. But still, when buying a used piano you may want additional help. As a fee service, I can go shopping with you to help you evaluate a piano. This service could save you from a costly mistake and give you additional confidence as you make your decision. This service is especially important if the piano you are buying is not in prime playing condition. Beware of ads which state: "All it needs is a tuning"! This may be an indication the piano needs much more than a tuning.
