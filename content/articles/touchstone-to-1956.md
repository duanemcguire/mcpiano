The Janssen Piano Company of New York made about 160,000 pianos from 1901 until 1964, when it sold to the Conn company. I service a number of Janssen console pianos from the 1950s that continue to be good instruments that are loved by their owners.

Today I tuned #134626 from 1956. As I began, I knew that I would like it. I liked it even more when I took the time to read the "Janssen Creed" inside the lid.

Many pianos of quality are made today, but where do we see this type of statement? Sure, we might say "this was just marketing," but I see it as a personal commitment to quality. Today we have ISO, CMM, Six-Sigma and scores of other process control and corporate accountability systems. And we're making excellent pianos. But in 1956 we had personal commitment and worker accountability, and we made excellent pianos. \[fbcomments\]
