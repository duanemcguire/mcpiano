An Adam Schaaf player piano recently arrived in my shop for a complete rebuild.   I'll be doing the piano work, and the player work will go to a player expert.   I'm pleased that my client has recognized the need for good piano work to precede good player work.   With good piano work, the player mechanism can perform at its best.

Work began with restoration of the keyframe, bottom board, and pedal trap work.
