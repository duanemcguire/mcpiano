When boring piano hammers, keeping chips away from the jig surface is a constant need.  I was tired of clearing the debris with a hand-held air nozzle.   $36 in parts from Amazon helped me to create a nice solution.   The heart of the solution is a 12V DC solenoid that is controlled by a magnetic switch.   The magnetic switch closes when the drill press quill descends.    Like a lot of shop improvements, I didn't get payback in the first use, but the drilling process is much more efficient when using this new fixture.
