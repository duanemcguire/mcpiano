This weekend our house is transforming into a recital hall!  We are pleased to be hosting a Christmas piano recital for Tiffany Bailey's piano students tomorrow evening.    I always love hearing other talent perform on my piano, so this is going to be especially enjoyable.  The piano is a Steinway model A3 from 1922.  I recently installed new Ronsen Weikert felt hammers on the instrument.

To prepare,  Justin DeJong helped me move the normal furniture into the garage.  We glided the piano over from the northwest corner to the southwest corner where it could be seen from two wings of the new recital hall.  This "gliding" was accomplished with my shop-made three-wheeled piano transporter.

Terri McGuire has been adding her touches with Christmas decor. It's good to have a master of event planning on the job! The recital hall will look a bit different with 30 chairs and people!   More pictures to come of tomorrow's event.
