I recently had the pleasure of rebuilding an Emerson upright piano from 1916.  This particular piano had been in one family for the past 100 years.   As is often the case, a treasured family piano still looks wonderful, so my work on the case was simply to clean,  polish and replace some missing knobs.   The musical instrument, inside, however got a rather complete make-over!  With age it really wasn't sounding good or playing well.

Now when we open up the case of the 1916 Emerson, we see a new piano. How does it sound? Well the customer says it's wonderful! And I believe it's very close to what it was in 1916.
