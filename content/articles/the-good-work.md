I paused for a moment in my work this morning to realize that I was doing exactly what I wanted to be doing.   Practicing the crafts of piano restoration fits me in such a fine way.   This morning I was doing key work on an 1880's Knabe grand, and while I applied my skill to restoration, I could pause to admire the work of craftsmen from 130 years ago.

James Michener is credited with the following:  

> _The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his information and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing._

I'm grateful that I can often reside in that zone. \[fbcomments\]
