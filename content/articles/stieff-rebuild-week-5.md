It was a vacation week! Terri and I enjoyed a few days in sunny California, and since we were near Modesto, we paid a visit to the shop of [Dale Erwin](http://www.erwinspiano.com). Dale was a gracious host, who shared his knowledge and enthusiasm for rebuilding and belly work. It's great to have him as a collaborator. Dale will be supplying the soundboard panel for the Stieff. I plan to do the ribbing. Here's Dale with a soundboard he made for a Steinway D: [![Dale Erwin with a soundboard he built](/images/medium/Dale-Erwin-with-Steinway-D-soundboard.jpg)(http://www.erwinspiano.com/)

While we were on vacation, FedEx was not. A package of handmade tools was waiting for me on my return:

A collection of hand made tools from Dana Mazzaglia


These tools were made by [Dana Mazzaglia](http://mazzagliatools.com/). All are used in piano belly work. You go to the head of the class if you can name each and its function.
