I expect to have more time for the rebuild in November, after I finish the rebuild of a fine, old Emerson upright. Customers come first! In the meantime, with the sub-contracted finishing, work does continue! Below, I'm doing the solo work of loading the plate (200+ pounds of iron) into my trailer. It's going to Heritage restorations for re-guilding.

The return trip brought home the case of the piano. The case has received a factory new (or better) hand rubbed lacquer finish. A work of art! The picture below doesn't quite do it justice, but you'll get the idea!
