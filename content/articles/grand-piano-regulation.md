This week I spent a day at a customer's home in Ogden, regulating a Yamaha GH1 made in 1993. It was rewarding work for me, and drew immediate praise from the players in the home. The very talented 12 year old player smiled and said, "Oh! It's so much easier to play now!" It's a privilege to be able to do this work.
