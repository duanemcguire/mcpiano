On this piano, my original mission was to replace the casters.  At some point, they had previously been replaced with 3" industrial casters.  That created a pedal height which was quite uncomfortable

However, when I examined the bottom of the piano for the bores needed to accept new piano casters, I found extensive damage.  The caster bores were damaged and the the bottom beam had lost its rear lamination.
