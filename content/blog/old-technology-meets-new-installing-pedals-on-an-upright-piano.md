While installing pedals on a 90 year old upright piano, I had the opportunity to upgrade materials, and have a little fun at the lathe. The old pivot system employed a hardwood dowel bushing in a cast iron bracket. The system was likely a good one for the first 30 years, but with wear, it became floppy and noisy, and broken. I chose to fabricate new bushings to be used in the old brackets using [UHMW (ultra high molecular weight polyethylene)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene) rod. UHMW is ideal for this application, since it is self-lubricating. For someone who doesn't do a lot of lathe work, it presented a bit of a creative challenge, and I'm pleased with the result. I'm sure it will be serviceable for many years, and earns a lifetime guarantee.
