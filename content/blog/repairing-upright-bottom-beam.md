excerpt: Showing some repair work to the back structure of an upright piano

On this piano, my original mission was to replace the casters.  At some point, they had previously been replaced with 3" industrial casters.  That created a pedal height which was quite uncomfortable

However, when I examined the bottom of the piano for the bores needed to accept new piano casters, I found extensive damage.  The caster bores were damaged and the the bottom beam had lost its rear lamination.
