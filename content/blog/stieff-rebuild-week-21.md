I am grateful for my customers, and they are taking my time! The Stieff Rebuild is not moving along, but the soundboard has arrived. The custom made soundboard was built by  [Erwin's Piano Restorations](http://www.erwinspiano.com/). I asked the Erwins to make three identical boards, as I have two more Stieff pianos of the same model. With this level of commitment, progress will continue!

The Sitka Spruce soundboard panels are beautiful, and one is just stunning with impressive flare in the grain.
