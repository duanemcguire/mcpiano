Amateur movers frequently damage the lower corner of upright pianos.  Shown here is my approach to repairing this damage on the Schilling and Sons piano.

![](/images/schilling/800/DSC00549.jpg)<BR/>The starting point. Typical damage to an old upright piano from amateur movers. Orientation - piano is laid on its back on a piano tilter.

The outside cuts will be made with care, assuring that the router base is flat against the case side. This is the tricky part, since their isn't as much surface for the router base there. The cut next to the guide is done from top to bottom (left to right). This assures that the rotation of the bit is pulling the router base into the guide rather than pushing it away. Thus we get a clean straight cut.

I had some nice mahogany hardwood, so I decided to do it without veneer, but solid wood instead. Here shows how the stock was re-sawn on the bandsaw. The recess cut in the piano side was approximately 11 mm. I setup the bandsaw to cut approximately 13 mm. Thus I had a comfortable excess for thickness sanding to final dimension.

![](/images/schilling/800/DSC00558.jpg)<BR/> For glue-up, there wasn't a practical way to clamp. I relied on the tight fit and the adhesion of the glue.
