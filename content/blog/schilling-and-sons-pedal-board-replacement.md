While stringing, I leaned lightly on the pedal board, and found myself with a problem!

The board was remarkably weak. close inspection revealed that the crack was started years ago, as staining is evident within the break.   The board also showed evidence of “worm holes” – which I suspect are actually holes from boring larvae.  The board was likely weak when installed back when.

In any event, my approach was to replace the entire board with a new piece of solid mahogany.   Fortunately I was able to source a nice piece locally.   By using solid hardwood, I was able to avoid veneering.
