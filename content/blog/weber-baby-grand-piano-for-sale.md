Shopping for a *new* baby grand?  STOP! This 2002 Weber baby grand is the ONE!  We've given this entry level grand piano an extreme make-over, and it is simply better than new.  

![](/images/weber-wg150/resized/2021-02-25%2017.47.49.resized.jpg)<BR>

This Weber piano was manufactured by Young Chang in 2002

Restoration work will included:

- Cleaning of the high gloss burgandy finish.
- Restringing: We installed Mapes "International Gold" piano wire and Mapes custom copper wound bass strings. As part of the process we installed new plate bushings and nickel plated tuning pins.
- New Hammers: We installed new Renner hammers and shanks as used in fine European pianos.  Coupled with the new strings, the result is a rich, satisfying tone.
- Touch weight refinement and regulation: We fine-tuned touch weight to concert specifications. With the re-balanced keyboard and fine regulation, pianists can enjoy even, controllable response throughout the dynamic range of the instrument.

Our work objective on this small grand, quite simply, was to make it better than new! Careful attention was given to every component of the piano.  Though this instrument was manufactured for an entry-level price.  In our recondtioning work, we are surpassing the manufacturing specifications to deliver a small piano of remarkable quality.  

Here, we've asserted that this piano is better than new, and know that is true when compared to its original manufacture.  However, to be fair and to compare apples to apples, the Weber WG-150 model was completely redesigned by master designer Del Fandrich in 2008.   The redesign produced a piano far superior to the 2002 edition.  Our work has incorporated some of the elements of Mr. Fandrich's redesign.

This lovely  Weber piano is offered for sale at $6,250.   Price includes the bench shown, in-home tuning, and standard delivery along the Wasatch Front.   

Utah State sales tax is applicable to purchase.
