<p>After having done it the hard way, it is such a delight to find the easy way by virtue of someone else&#8217;s good thinking! Such is the case with the wonderful jig described below. When applying new key tops to piano keys, the notches surrounding the black keys present a significant challenge. Except for the notches, the sides of the keys can be trimmed flush with a flush trimming router bit, in much the same manner as one would trim plastic laminate on a counter top. But obviously, a flush trimming bit cannot do the notches. When I did piano rebuilding in the 80&#8217;s, this issue was handled with a hand held file. It was very tedious work.</p>
<p>In the June 1991 issue of the <a href="http://www.ptg.org">Piano Technicians Journal</a> an article by <a href="http://www.spurlocktools.com">Bill Spurlock</a> describes a router jig for cleaning the notches. The jig below is an implementation of his excellent thinking.</p>

<p>The jig is used once the sides of the key top have been trimmed flush using a flush trimming bit. When trimming, the notch is left untouched, and a perfect notch is acheived with this jig. The router bit is a 1/2&#8243; spiral bit. The stop is 3/16&#8243; steel. When I first fabricated the jig I had no steel in the shop and tried a stop made of 1/8&#8243; brass. The brass flexed resulting in inaccuracies. The 5/8&#8243; hole in the stop was drilled to accept a bench dog for clamping. When I replaced the 1/8&#8243; brass stop with the 3/16&#8243; steel, I found that clamping was no longer necessary.</p>
