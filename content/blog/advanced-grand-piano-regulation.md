#### AREA PIANO TECHNICIAN COMPLETES ADVANCED TRAINING



“Grand Action Regulation in 37-Steps” covered all phases of tuning and regulation of grand pianos. Attendees learned how to increase action control, even movement, maximize the dynamic range and achieve the fastest speed of repetition available. The course also included a detailed demonstration and explanation of the 37 steps method of regulating a grand piano alternating with guided practice on each step.

Duane passed a final regulation skills test at the end of class.

“Piano technicians don’t necessarily learn their trade through years of personal instruction these days,” said Jim Coleman, RPT, President of the PTG. “Today’s discriminating players demand skilled technicians and this class is one of the ways technicians can learn to offer the highest level of service.”

Limited to 10 participants, the hands-on class offered by PTG is the successor to the well-respected  “Little Red Schoolhouse” program offered by Yamaha Corporation of America. Yamaha approached PTG in January 2012 asking if the association would be interested in taking over the program. PTG jumped at the opportunity and began working with Yamaha to ensure a successful continuation and expansion of the class.

The result is a class that takes the best parts of the previous program but extends it, ensuring those who take it acquire skills no matter the piano manufacturer.

“These twenty-four hours in intensive instruction really helped me to hone my skills in grand piano regulation,” said Duane. “A great deal of sensitivity is required with these skills, and that sensitivity is now sharper than ever.”
