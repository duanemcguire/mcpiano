The cobbler's children go without shoes. But this piano technician is breaking out of that paradigm. New to my living room is a Steinway and Sons Model A-3 built in New York in 1922. After I completed three days of work on it, the piano is very pleasing to play. At some time, it will be completely rebuilt; but for now, it is a very nice "daily driver", to borrow from classic car enthusiast lingo. That time will not come until the high-end restoration of the 6'3" Charles Stieff (1911) is complete.
