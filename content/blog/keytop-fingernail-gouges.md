This photo shows the gouges created by fingernails.  This is damage that is not readily visible, but the performer may be sensitive to it.   The sensitivity my be felt perception or subliminal.   But for my work, I want it to be absent! (This photo was taken after the old keytop was removed, but before the the old keyfront was removed.)
